# Mars Rover
The circuit diagram and Arduino program can be used to make a "self-driving car". To assemble the car, you will need:
1. The perseids smart car chassis
2. Arduino + cable
3. 1/4 size breadboard
4. HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
5. 2 NPN transistors
6. 14+ jumper wires
7. Copper tape
8. 9V battery (this will need to be replaced often)
9. 9V battery clip connector to Arduino
10. Masking tape
